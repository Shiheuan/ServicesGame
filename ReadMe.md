the first thing I came to mind is Service Locator Pattern. So I added a basic demo in this project, and will develop this framework based on this basic.

PS. I'm not a native English speaker. The reason why I'm writing in English is that I hope more people will participate in this dev activity. And please be free to point out my mistakes. Thx.
